          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hello, I'm Todd Nestor.  This is a portfolio of some of the websites I have developed.  If you'd like to see more of a resume you can go to my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/todd-nestor/3a/574/560">LinkedIn profile</a>.  I started out learning web development in 2000 when I was 13 years old.  It started because I was at Wal-mart and saw a book titled, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592577881/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1592577881&linkCode=as2&tag=flextechmana-20&linkId=N4I5ACFCFYPALXD6">The Complete Idiot's Guide to Creating a Website</a><img src="http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=flextechmana-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1592577881" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></em> (probably a much earlier version than this link is to) and asked my mom to buy it for me.  I read the nearly 400 page book cover-to-cover that night.  The next day after I got home from school I started building my first web page.</p>
          <p>Not long after that I started learning JavaScript and then moved on to learn Perl to create my first interactive applications.  Around 2005 I got a job as a web developer for a company called Aros.net and PHP and MySQL became my bread and butter. That company eventually went bankrupt, but I have continued to do freelance work throughout the years and am currently looking at getting back into web development full time and am looking for a position.  That's not to say I don't freelance anymore, if you want to hire me for full-time, part-time, or freelance work, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
          <p>My skills have expanded now to include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>PHP</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>MySQL</li>
            <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>AJAX</li>
            <li>HTML5</li>
            <li>CSS3</li>
            <li>Twitter Bootstrap</li>
            <li>VBA</li>
            <li>MS Excel</li>
            <li>MS Access</li>
            <li>Redis</li>
            <li>Heroku</li>
            <li>AWS - still expanding my knowledge on this one</li>
          </ul>
          <p>I am always learning new things about the languages and technologies I already know, and am also always learning new languages and technologies.  Besides web development, I also spent six years in the Army National Guard where I was trained as a Chinese linguist (comes in handy since my wife is Chinese) and an Intelligence Analyst.  I spent nine months working as an analyst in Kosovo as part of the NATO Peacekeeping troops.  When I'm not working I love hiking, biking, kayaking, reading, and watching movies.</p>
          <p>Besides a former soldier and a web developer I am also a published author.  The Foreign Language Press (a publisher in China) has published one article of mine (<a href="http://www.cbi.gov.cn:8080/wisework/content/125784.html"><em>Meeting Nanjing:Ankara, Two Transportation Hubs</em></a>) and I have two more pending publishing (both about Nanjing as well) and also a book (titled <em>Next Stop Beijing</em>).</p>
